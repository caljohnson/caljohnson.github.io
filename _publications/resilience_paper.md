excerpt: 'This paper studies how migration and ecological network dynamics affect the resilience of populations and regime shift cascades. We focused on populations with variable-strength Allee effects, and used bifurcation and stability analysis to describe the quantitative and qualitative changes that occur in a two-population model as environmental and migration parameters varied.'

This paper studies how migration and ecological network dynamics affect the resilience of populations and regime shift cascades. 
In collaboration with Prof. Alan Hastings, we focused on populations with variable-strength Allee effects. 
We used bifurcation and stability analysis to describe the quantitative and qualitative changes that occur in a two-population model as environmental and migration parameters varied.
