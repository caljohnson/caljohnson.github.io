This paper studies how migration and ecological network dynamics affect the resilience of populations and regime shift cascades. 
In collaboration with Prof. Alan Hastings, we focused on populations with variable-strength Allee effects. 
We used bifurcation and stability analysis to describe the quantitative and qualitative changes that occur in a two-population model as environmental and migration parameters varied.
